Radiometry was built on an abstraction of light based on particles flowing through space. Therefore, some of light effects like polarization do not naturally fit into this method. 

*Radiant Transfer* : 
- based on radiometric principles and operates at the geometric optics level

A system with geomtric optics level assumes :
- Linearity : 
- Energy Conservation : scattering events never can produce more energy than they started with
- No polarization
