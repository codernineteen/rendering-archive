We got the probability of reflection and refraction.
But still we don't know in which angle are refracted rays continuing their path.

1. light slows down when entering a denser medium
	The index of refraction tells us exactly how much it slows down
	$$n_{medium}=\frac{{speed \space of \space light \space in \space vacumm}}{speed \space of \space light \space in \space the \space medium}=\frac{c}{v_{medium}}$$
	For example, In regard to glass medium.
	$n_{glass}$0 : 1.5
	$$1.5=\frac{c}{v_{glass}}=\frac{300,000,000(m/s)}{v_{glass}}$$
	Therefore, the speed of light in glass medium is $200,000,000(m/s)$.
	- visualization for the effect
	  If we look at the blue marked part carefully, we can see that the speed of light slower down.

But why the light refract inwards?
Here are famous intuition for this question.
Let's replace the air and glass medium with each 'road' and 'mud'.
Then we can think of the light as 'a car' on the road initially.
When one of tires of the car enters the mud region, only that tire will be slowed down.
But still other tires still keep their speed against road.
This difference of speed between one tire and the other makes the car rotate toward a direction close to reverse of surface normal.

We also can describe this in terms of wave of the light.
For the single wavefront of the light, the part of wave that already entered in the glass medium was slowed down. 
On the other hand, another part of the wave that still keeps their radius keep the speed of light.

# The snell's law equation
$$\frac{sin(\theta_1)}{sin(\theta_2)} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{n_1}{n_2}$$


# Total internal reflection

At critical angle, the angle of refraction agains the surface normal is 90 degree.
If the angle is over the critical angle, there will be only reflection inside the same medium.

By reordering snell's law, we can write
$$sin(\theta_1)=(\frac{n_2}{n_1}sin(\theta_2))\space|_{\theta_2=90\degree}$$
$$sin(\theta_1)=\frac{n_2}{n_1}\cdot 1$$
$$\theta_1=\theta_{crit}=arcsin(\frac{n_2}{n_1})$$
